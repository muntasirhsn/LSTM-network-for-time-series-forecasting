# Introduction 
Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can be used for time-series forecasting. LSTM networks are capable of learning features from input sequences of data and can be used to predict multi-step sequences. In this example, a simple Vanilla LSTM architecture (an LSTM model with a single hidden LSTM layer and an output layer for prediction) is used for multistep time-series forecasting. For an excellent intro duction to LSTMs, look up [Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-for-time-series-forecasting/)
# Getting Started
The LSTM_univariate_multistep_output_github.ipynb file is the main file for running the LSTM model. The publicly available time-series energy usage data of IIT, Delhi is sourced from here. 
The model is a simple Vanilla LSTM architecture
